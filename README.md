# **Robot Lamp**

## A lamp works _with_ you.
---
This is a senior design project for 5 students studying Mechanical Engineering at UMass Amherst. We use this repo to maintain our code base (mostly python 3), and showcase our progress.

We are designing a lamp that can be used in exam rooms for physician or medical staff to work on patients in a sterile environment. To make the operator's job simpler, the lamp will track hand movement and gestures to provide light where ever needed, without requiring the operator to touch the lamp.

This is a complex, multi-disciplined, ambitious project. To better distribute the work, we have organized ourselves into the following roles:

| Team Member |    Role  |
|-------------|----------|
|Zak Vaneck| Team Lead|
|Tom Randolph| Systems Engineer|
|Nate Turner | Software Engineer|
|Andrew Mulcahy | Manufacturing Engineer|
|Ross Adams| Mechanical Engineer|


### DISCLAIMER
This project is very much a W.I.P. and will be in varying states of functionality.

#### TODO:

* Code Roadmap
* Usage Instructions
* Include CAD Models
